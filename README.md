# RonenMethod1D

This repository contains the source files to implement the Ronen method in a 1D diffusion solver using finite differences. Currents are derived by following the theory of collision probability methods in HÃ©bert's and Lewis and Miller textbooks, being based on reduced escape probabilities.

Reference solutions are obtained by resolving the integral transport equation by the collision probability method.

Three simple 1D geometry frames are studied: slab, cylinder and sphere.
