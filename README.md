# RonenMethod1D (private version)

This repository contains the source files to implement the Ronen method in a 1D diffusion solver using finite differences. Currents are derived by the theory of collision probability methods following HÃ©bert's and Lewis-and-Miller textbooks.

Reference solutions are obtained by resolving the integral transport equation by the collision probability method.

Three simple 1D geometry frames are studied: slab, cylinder and sphere.

## Installation
