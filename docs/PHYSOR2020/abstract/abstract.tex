\begin{abstract}%
The Ronen method is implemented and studied numerically in two-group one-dimensional homogeneous slab configuration. Since slow convergence is observed for the scalar flux especially near the vacuum boundary, new techniques for accelerating the convergence are investigated. For example, we use integral flux intermediate values as new boundary conditions at each iteration and we update iteratively the extrapolated boundary using the corrected local diffusion coefficient. Moreover, the pCMFD scheme is implemented and its performances are compared with those of standard CMFD scheme.
