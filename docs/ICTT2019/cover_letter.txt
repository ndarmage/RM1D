Dear Editor,

Please find our manuscript for publication on JCTT, after review and possible acceptance.

This work presents the Ronen Method under the formalism used for collision probability methods in simple 1D geometries.

We hope that the topic will meet the interest of the readers and provide novelty in literature.

Thanks for your kind attention.
Best regards,


Daniele Tomatis,
on behalf of his co-authors.
